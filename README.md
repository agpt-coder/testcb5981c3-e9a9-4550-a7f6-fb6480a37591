# test

To create an endpoint that connects to Groq and takes in an emoji as input to explain its meaning, you'll follow these steps:

1. Initialize your FastAPI application by installing FastAPI and Uvicorn. Use `pip install fastapi uvicorn` for installation.
2. Create a new file for your application, for instance, `app.py`, and import FastAPI to initiate the app object.
3. Define an endpoint that accepts an emoji as input. Considering emojis are strings, this can be accomplished using a path or query parameter. Your endpoint might look like `@app.get("/emoji/{emoji_input}")`.
4. Within the defined endpoint, utilize the search information gathered earlier to interpret the emoji. You would typically use the 'emoji' Python library for converting the emoji to text, employing `emoji.demojize(emoji_input)`.
5. Before connecting to Groq, it's important to understand that directly connecting to Groq to interpret emoji meanings may not be straightforward since Groq focuses on hardware acceleration and its APIs are more geared towards computational tasks rather than data interpretation or text analysis. Therefore, you may need to reconsider or clarify how Groq would be specifically utilized for interpreting emojis. If Groq provides an API for text analysis or any functionality that could be leveraged for emoji interpretation, integrate those API calls within your FastAPI route.
6. Ensure your endpoint returns the interpreted meaning of the emoji, possibly with additional processing or analysis done through Groq if applicable and available.
7. Run your FastAPI application with `uvicorn app:app --reload` command.

Note: The direct usage of Groq for emoji interpretation requires further clarification. Groq's platform is primarily for accelerating computation-heavy tasks. It's suggested to explore Groq's documentation or support to understand if and how their API can be specifically used for text or emoji interpretation, aside from the computational tasks it's designed for.

## What you'll need to run this
* An unzipper (usually shipped with your OS)
* A text editor
* A terminal
* Docker
  > Docker is only needed to run a Postgres database. If you want to connect to your own
  > Postgres instance, you may not have to follow the steps below to the letter.


## How to run 'test'

1. Unpack the ZIP file containing this package

2. Adjust the values in `.env` as you see fit.

3. Open a terminal in the folder containing this README and run the following commands:

    1. `poetry install` - install dependencies for the app

    2. `docker-compose up -d` - start the postgres database

    3. `prisma generate` - generate the database client for the app

    4. `prisma db push` - set up the database schema, creating the necessary tables etc.

4. Run `uvicorn project.server:app --reload` to start the app

## How to deploy on your own GCP account
1. Set up a GCP account
2. Create secrets: GCP_EMAIL (service account email), GCP_CREDENTIALS (service account key), GCP_PROJECT, GCP_APPLICATION (app name)
3. Ensure service account has following permissions: 
    Cloud Build Editor
    Cloud Build Service Account
    Cloud Run Developer
    Service Account User
    Service Usage Consumer
    Storage Object Viewer
4. Remove on: workflow, uncomment on: push (lines 2-6)
5. Push to master branch to trigger workflow
